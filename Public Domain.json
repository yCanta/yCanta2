came to save His people\nFrom earths dark night of sin\nO Savior child of Mary\nWho feels our human woes\nO Savior King of glory\nWho all our weakness knows\nBring us at last we pray\nTo the full joys of heaven\nAnd into endless day\nHere is the text of the shorter Fernando Ortega version --\nVerse 1\nLo how a Rose eer blooming\nFrom tender stem hath sprung\nOf Jesses lineage coming\nAs seers of old have sung\nIt came upon them bright --\nAmid the cold of winter\nWhen half-spent was the night\nVerse 2\nIsaiah was foretold it\nThe Rose I have in mind\nWith Mary we behold it\nThe virgin mother kind\nTo show Gods love aright --\nVerse 3\nThis Flowr whose fragrance tender\nWith sweetness fills the air\nDispels with glorious splendor\nThe darkness everywhere\nTrue man yet very God --\nFrom sin

resolve but this is easily remedied A good rendition of the traditional tune can be heard at:\nOne commentator 300 years ago said You can sing this at meter 72 and it will be a dirge\nI suggested doing it at meter 95 but the choice is yours\nA nice more modern somewhat folksy rendition can be heard at:\nOR\nI like the newer tune without their added chorus better I find it more joyful than the traditional tune Other tune options include:\nWaltham the tune of I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day\nHursley the tune of Sun of My Soul 625 in the Celebration Hymnal\nWake From Your Sleep tune of same on St Louis Jesuits Gentle Night album\nThe Water Is Wide could work well with minor word-smithing\nOf these Hursley was my first choice followed by the High Street tune Muriel does not like Hursley because the 3rd syllable of the 1st line has a double-note which does not fit well with verses 1 and 2 As for The Water Is Wide Im not sure the mood of the tune fits the message of the hymn I have now settled on a hybrid tune of my own whose 1st line matches that of Jesus the Very Thought of Thee the 2nd and 3rd lines match those of Wake From Your Sleep and the 4th line is of my own making I would like to improve or replace the tune for this line The meter of this tune is The chords above reflect this tune BH\nNeeds work: splitting of lines to make 8 line stanzas instead of 4\nNeeds chord work: revisit the tune for the last line not well

Fletcher\nOthers attribute it to W E Lindsay or W P Jay\nAbout W B Stevens:\nReverend Stevens was converted at an early age through the\ninfluence of a godly father and mother The era of Chautauqua\noutdoor meetings the fervor of religious revival tent meetings\nwere exciting and a part of his life Suffering many trials\nin his ministry Reverend W B Stevens achieved prominence\nas an evangelistic preacher as well as a singer and songwriter\nHe taught singing schools published five songbooks and wrote\nas many as seven hundred songs In 1889 W B Stevens was the\nfounding minister of the Holiness Church at Queen City where\nhe held tent meetings in the village park Mollie as he fondly\ncalled his wife assisted him during the evangelistic engagements\nthat took him to ten different states All of their children\npreceded the couple in death This intense grief was reflected\nin some of his song writing however melancholy was expressed\nin the gospel tunes written in that era so this was not unusual\nThree of his songs - Give Your Flowers Now - My Humble Cottage Home -\nand Father Along - were especially loved\nAbout W A Stevens:\nThe lyrics to the song were written in 1911 by Rev W A Fletcher\nan itinerant preacher while he was travelling to the\nIndian Territories by train Fletcher was feeling depressed\nbecause his wife was expecting their first-born child in a few weeks\nand he wouldnt be present for the occasion He felt that\nhis priorities were with his ministry in the Indian Territories\nand wrote the lyrics to reflect his frame of mind at the time\nSitting next to him on the train was J R Baxter a gospel music\npromoter who was quite taken with the lyrics that Fletcher\nwas writing and offered him 200 for them Mr Baxter subsequently\nhad them put to music and the song has been quite popular\nin the gospel music arena ever since\nThe song deals with a Christians dismay at the apparent prosperity\nof the wicked when contrasted with the suffering of the righteous\nThe repeated theme is that in heaven the truth will be revealed\nVery excellent blog post about the four claims to authorship of this hymn:\nhttp:drhamrickblogspotcom201312farther-alonghtml\n","_id":"s-i770849864","_rev":"3-9efc9e006f8379a0852384820b260f5e"}},{"id":"s-i-1291635258","key":"s-i-1291635258","value":{"rev":"3-ab04dd4272711f8c7084854f5a6b6754"},"doc":{"added":1718072558823,"addedBy":"u-carl

perfect justice\nKissed a guilty world in love\nIn Thy truth Thou dost direct me\nBy Thy Spirit through Thy Word\nAnd Thy grace my need is meeting\nAs I trust in Thee my Lord\nAll Thy fullness Thou

me\nThou Thyself hast set me free\nLet me all Thy love accepting\nLove Thee ever all my days\nLet me seek Thy kingdom only\nAnd my life be to Thy praise\nThis hymn was the heart-throb of the Welsh

a\ntune by the famous Indian Christian Sadhu Sundar Singh occasioned by\nthe martyrdom of a Christian family in the state of Assam in northeastern\nIndia According to the story the local village chief told the father of\nthe family to deny Christ or they would kill his children and his wife\nThe father refused to deny Christ and they then shot his two sons with\narrows killing them The chief then told him to not deny Christ or they\nwould kill his wife He refused and they then killed his wife the same way\nThe chief then threatened his own life and he still did not deny Christ\nso they then killed him But after that the chief was so impressed by\nthe mans faith that he and the people in the village became Christians\nYou can hear this recounted on several YouTube videos One of these is:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchvGQ2mRgIteFw\nThe Wikipedia article about the song mentions Singh and the martyrdom story\nbut it also mentions the song may have been written by Simon K Marak:\nhttps:enwikipediaorgwikiIHaveDecidedtoFollowJesus\nThe best analysis of the origin of this song concludes that the song did\nnot come from Sadhu Sundar Singh but was most likely written by a pastor\nfrom Assam named Simon K Marak You can read that article

sweet\nThe words repeat\nOf peace on earth\nGood will to men\nI thought how\nAs the day had come\nThe belfries of\nAll Christendom\nHad rolled along\nThe constant song\nTill ringing singing\nOn its way\nThe world revolved\nFrom night to day\nA voice a chime\nA chant sublime\nThen from each black\nAccursed mouth\nThe cannons thundered\nIn the South\nAnd with the sound\nThe carols drowned\nIt was as if\nAn earthquake rent\nThe hearthstones of\nA continent\nAnd made forlorn\nThe households born\nAnd in despair\nI bowed my head\nThere is no peace\nOn earth I said\nFor hate is strong\nIt mocks the song\nThen pealed the bells\nMore loud and deep:\nGod is not dead\nNor does He sleep\nThe wrong shall fail\nThe right prevail\nWith peace on earth\nSo ringing singing\nThe world will turn\nAnd praises sing\nTo God the King:\nHis peace on earth\nIn 1861 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was tragically widowed when\nhis wife died in a fire In trying to save her he himself had\nbeen seriously burned himself In December 1863 his oldest son\nCharles was wounded and nearly left paralyzed in a Civil War battle\nWhen Christmas Day arrived Longfellow wrote this poem out of feeling\na strong contrast between the Christmas message and the sorrows of\nthe war that was raging His version of the poem consisted of\nverses 1 to 7 verse 8 a modification of verse 3 was added to\nbring the hymn to a better sense of closure\nMost hymnals omit verses 4 and 5 that express the horror of the\nCivil War This has the effect of losing the profoundness of the\nmeditation Longfellow put in verse At the same time it is\ndifficult for the congregation to sing all eight verses I suggest\nthat they sing verses 1 to 3 after which a narrator should slowly\nand thoughtfully read verses 4 to 6 The congregation should then\nconclude with singing verses 7 and 8

variation may be heard here:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchvzT2bbWJDnSs\nI dont like Excells version due to its omission of the beginning and\nother parts of the hymn plus his addition of his own 2-line chorus\nId like to reflect on the best way to put this hymn into Canaan usage BH\nMuriel had a good tune idea that will fit the 4 verses above as written\nby Newton The Excell tune only uses stanzas 1b 2a and 3b as verses\nfollowing each of these with a 4-line chorus he added Thus each Excell\nversechorus will cover one verse of Newtons hymn We can use the\nExcell versechorus melody as the tune of each Newton verse This will\navoid the repetition of using the Martyrdom tune 8 times and also avoid\nthe way Excell through away 58th of Newtons hymn while repeating his\nown chorus three times I like the proposal Next up: review the\nNewton verses for any needed word-smithing and modernizing and decide\nwhether any of Newtons verses could be recombined in a way to improve\nthem

dress\nThrough endless ages\nIn these arrayed\nWith joy Ill gladly\nLift up my head\nAdd meter comment here explaining the melisma problem\nGermanys supposed meter: 8-8-8-8 and Wesleys translation\nGermanys true meter: 9-10-10-10\nWith our line splits as shown the tune notes divide as follows:\n4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4 supposedly\n4-5-4-6-5-5-5-5 in reality\nThe actual way this gets resolved is by extensive use of melisma\nmultiple notes per syllable which is difficult for congregations\nI am trying to wordsmith Wesleys text to remove as much of the melisma\nas possible while at the same time improving the thought content BH\nI still need to look at eliminating one or more of the three\nvery similar verses that start with Lord I believe BH\nBold shall I stand\nIn Thy awesome day\nFor who aught to\nMy own account shall lay\nFully absolved\nBy Thee I am\nFrom sin and worry\nFrom all guilt and shame\nThe holy meek\nImmaculate Lamb\nWho from the\nFathers holy bosom came\nHas died to save me\nHas lived to atone\nNow my great Sovreign\nAnd Savior I own\nLord I believe\nThy most precious blood\nWas poured upon the\nMercy-seat of God\nTo evry sinner\nGods arms outspread\nHis blood so holy\nFor my soul was shed\nWere sinners een more\nThan all the grains\nUpon the ocean-shore\nThou hast for mankind\nThe ransom paid\nFor all a full\nAtonement made\nThe full price is paid\nFor evry soul\nAtonement has been made\nAnd evry soul\nThy grace may prove\nLoved with an\nEverlasting love\nWhen from the dust\nOf my death I rise\nTo claim my dwelling\nIn the glowing skies\nEen then shall this\nBe all my plea:\nJesus has lived\nAnd has died for me\nJesus be endless\nAcclaim to Thee\nWhose boundless mercy\nGiven was to me\nFor me and all whom\nThy hands have made\nThe everlasting\nRansom paid\nOh let the dead\nNow attend Thy voice\nNow bid Thy erst-while\nEnemies rejoice\nTheir beauty this\nTheir glorious dress\nJesus tis Thy blood\nThe original text from Zinzendorf has 24 verses You can see them here:\nhttp:wwwhymntimecomtchhtmjtbljtbloodrhtm\nThe tune Germany the most common setting used is ascribed to Beethoven\nWilliam Gardiner was the arranger You can hear it here in a too-slow\norgan and chorale rendition:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv34eNHE3FsEY\nI much prefer this too-fast accapella rendition I would slow it down a\nlittle bit starting at the 4:40 mark:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv5AS5BJta7D4\nThe hymn has been set to quite a few other tunes\nHere is another setting by the Hymnal Project:\nhttps:wwwthehymnalprojectcomjesus-thy-blood-and-righteousness\nI dont like this tune for this hymn it is too smaltzy for the message\nAnd here is another setting to the tune St Crispin by George Elvey:\nhttps:myhymnaryorgsongdynamic731jesusthybloodandrighteousness\nI dont like this tune for this hymn it just doesnt move me\nAnd here is another tune Hursley that is worth considering:\nhttps:gracemusicussheetmusicjesus-your-blood-and-righteousness\nHursley has the advantage of being easier to learn than Germany but it is\nalso less interesting it seems a bit repetitive\nThe group using the tune of Hursley only uses four of the verses and\nhas modernized and rearranged the words a bit You can see that here:\nhttps:s3amazonawscomgraceimmanuelgracemusicHymnal2nd-edspiralJesus2CYourBloodandRighteousness7x10pdf\nI have decided to go with the most commonly-used tune Germany\nThe chords above are for that tune

rejoice\nTheir beauty this\nTheir glorious dress\nJesus tis Thy blood\nThe original text from Zinzendorf has 24 verses You can see them here:\nhttp:wwwhymntimecomtchhtmjtbljtbloodrhtm\nThe tune Germany the most common setting used is ascribed to Beethoven\nWilliam Gardiner was the arranger You can hear it here in a too-slow\norgan and chorale rendition:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv34eNHE3FsEY\nI much prefer this too-fast accapella rendition I would slow it down a\nlittle bit starting at the 4:40 mark:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv5AS5BJta7D4\nThe hymn has been set to quite a few other tunes\nHere is another setting by the Hymnal Project:\nhttps:wwwthehymnalprojectcomjesus-thy-blood-and-righteousness\nI dont like this tune for this hymn it is too smaltzy for the message\nAnd here is another setting to the tune St Crispin by George Elvey:\nhttps:myhymnaryorgsongdynamic731jesusthybloodandrighteousness\nI dont like this tune for this hymn it just doesnt move me\nAnd here is another tune Hursley that is worth considering:\nhttps:gracemusicussheetmusicjesus-your-blood-and-righteousness\nHursley has the advantage of being easier to learn than Germany but it is\nalso less interesting it seems a bit repetitive\nThe group using the tune of Hursley only uses four of the verses and\nhas modernized and rearranged the words a bit You can see that here:\nhttps:s3amazonawscomgraceimmanuelgracemusicHymnal2nd-edspiralJesus2CYourBloodandRighteousness7x10pdf\nI have decided to go with the most commonly-used tune Germany\nThe chords above are for that tune

at last shall come the day we see Him\nThrough His own redeeming saving love\nFor that child so dear and gentle\nIs our Lord who reigns in heavn above\nAnd He leads His children on\nTo the place where He Himself has gone\nNot in that poor humble lowly stable\nWith the ass and oxen standing by\nWe shall see Him on that day in heaven\nSeated at Gods own right hand on high\nThere His children gather

this hymn suffers in multiple ways The text is archaic\nand the music is downright spooky more suited to the Adams Family than\nto a hymn about Jesus awesome love For this reason there have been\nmultiple attempts to rescue it These include updating the language and\nfinding a better tune The best attempt at this that I have found is\nSovereign Graces version sung by Aaron Keyes:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchvmSu-YOR4eRI\nThe meter for the hymn is 8787D a meter for which many hymn tunes exist\nIve considered reusing one of the familiar hymn tunes we know that would be\nsuitable suitable tunes include What A Friend We Have In Jesus\nAll The Way My Savior Leads Me Brother Let Me Be Your Servant\nJoyful Joyful We Adore Thee etc\nAnother tune that could be used is that of Morning Has Broken Here is a\nrendition by Audry Assad and Fernando Ortega:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv1vUhwyjdk8A\nFor whatever reason they chose to do verse 1 the 2nd half of verse 3\nand the first half of verse 2\nGenerally speaking we dont like reusing hymn tunes therefore we would\nprefer to pick one that we dont use in our repertoire Since we dont\nsing Morning Has Broken much it might be a good choice I dont find\nthat it fits the sentiments of Oh The Deep Deep Love of Jesus as well as\nit does the words of Morning Has Broken however

its Christmas and we greet Him\nComing even now to save\nFor the Lord of our salvation\nWas not captive to the grave\nOut of Egypt came the Savior\nMans Immanuel to be\nChristmas shines with Easter glory\nGlory of eternity\nOn a night while silent shepherds\nWatched their flocks upon the plain\nCame a message with its summons\nBrought by song of angel train:\nLo in Davids little village\nHas arrived the shepherd King\nAnd each shepherd to his Master\nMust his lamb as offring bring\nWhen there shone the star of David\nIn the spangled eastern sky\nKings arrived to pay their homage\nTo the Christ the Lord most high\nYet not all for lo there rings out\nThrough the streets a fearful cry\nFor a king who will not worship\nHas decreed that Christ must die\nThe above is a folkcountry version of the original hymn in which\nverse 4 was turned into a chorus You can hear a rendition of this by\nMichael Stephen McIntyre and family at:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchvj5epaoIzCc\nThe traditional tune is quite simple almost a childrens tune\nYou can hear a rendition of this by an Indian choir at:\nhttps:wwwyoutubecomwatchv-lYLB4-Q9c\nMuriel and I prefer the folkcountry version Its minor chords and\ndifferent pacing make for a more thoughtful meditation of the words\nI also prefer McIntyres rendition at a slower speed I play his at\n075 speed You could argue for 08 speed not one of the YouTube\noptions but hes going too fast at his normal speed\nStill be settled: Should we use McIntyres tune for the chorus\nor just keep the same tune as the verses Right now the chords\nin the chorus above reflect the same tune as the verse The chords\nfor McIntyres tune appear in a comment below\nBH\nThis beautiful Christmas hymn was written by a Sri Lankan minister\nI have made a few very small word changes to fit the tune better or\nto remove archaisms

worth considering for improving that verse BH\nJames Taylor re-popularized this song in 1991 His version only used\nverses 1 2 and 5 and then concluding with this ending:\nAnd both shall row\nI must say that I think Taylor excised far too much of the songs lyrics\nSure it is a sad song but if you cut away too much of the content\nyou do not get the full pathos being expressed BH\nThis song has good lyrics but the rhyming scheme is not consistent\nCan that be fixed BH\nGood sources for chords:\nhttp:wwwmusic-for-music-teacherscomeasy-guitar-songshtml

grace\nThrough death into life everlasting\nHe passed and well follow Him there\nWe are freed from sins power and dominion\nAnd one day His throne we will share\nHes promised to be with us always\nHe loves us and we are His bride\nHe never will leave us or fail us\nForever well be by His side\nOriginal verse 2:\nHe passed and we follow Him there\nOver us sin no more has dominion\nNow far more than conquerrs we are\nAnother variant of verse 2:\nOriginal verse 3:\nHis Word shall not fail you -- He promised\nBelieve Him and all will be well:\nThen go to a world that is dying\nHis perfect salvation to tell\nIm not impressed with these lyrics the last 2 lines seem unrelated\nto the message of the song I think this verse should be improved BH\nThe tune for these verses can be heard

Battle of Turnhout during\ntheir war for liberation from Catholic Spain The words We gather\ntogether had great significance because Protestants were forbidden to\ngather for worship under Spains rule\nAdrianus Valerius is not cited as the author because the words of the\ncurrent hymn bear little resemblance to the translation of his Dutch\nlyrics Verses 1 to 3 were written by Theodore Baker in 1894 as a\nloose transliteration of the Dutch sentiments Verse 4 by Paul Sjolund\nwas added in 1984 Kremsers tune dates to 1877\nThe hymn has become closely associated with Thanksgiving in the\nUnited States most people have no knowledge of its historical roots\nSome Christian churches object to the references to military victory\nthough in World War 2 the hymn increased greatly in popularity\nbecause both Americans and British citizens saw Nazi Germany in\nthe verse 1 phrase the wicked oppressing\nWe Praise Thee O God Our Redeemer Creator by Julia Cory\nalso using Kremsers tune is another loose transliteration of\nValerius hymn that omits the military aspects so it can serve\nas a replacement for those who object to them\nI have made minor refinements to cause the wording to fit the\nnotes of the tune better\nBH\n","_id":"s-i-758906067","_rev":"3-3649c0e2d036f559ac8de5b272f33934"}},{"id":"s-i942054452","key":"s-i942054452","value":{"rev":"3-86d6ecd70617eb1ae76e69f3cdc7a645"},"doc":{"added":1718072562565,"addedBy":"u-carl

long time seeking up and down\nTo find a lodging in the town\nBut mark how all things came to pass\nFrom every door repelled alas\nAs long foretold their refuge all\nWas but an humble oxs stall\nNear Bethlehem did shepherds keep\nTheir flocks of lambs and feeding sheep\nTo whom Gods angels did appear\nWhich put the shepherds in great fear\nPrepare and go the angels said\nTo Bethlehem be not afraid\nFor there youll find this happy morn\nA princely Babe sweet Jesus born\nWith thankful heart and joyful mind\nThe shepherds went the Babe to find\nAnd as Gods angel had foretold\nThey did our Savior Christ behold\nWithin a manger He was laid\nAnd by his side the virgin maid\nAttending on the Lord of Life\nWho came to earth to end all strife\nThere were three wise men from afar\nDirected by a glorious star\nAnd on they wandered night and day\nUntil they came where Jesus lay\nAnd when they came unto that place\nWhere our beloved Messiah was\nThey humbly cast them at His feet\nWith gifts of gold and incense sweet\nThis carols range works well in the key of D Guitar players can\nplay it in the key of D with no capo just use yCantas transpose\nfunction to get those chords or it can be

the days of Galilee\nDisease still flees at His command\nBut ere His touch your frame can feel\nYou too must still stretch forth your hand\nWhat though you feel so weak and faint\nHe can your will with strength endue\nNew faith and courage breathe within\nAnd work in you to will and do\nReach out to meet His quickening touch\nTake up your bed arise and stand\nAnd pressing through to meet your Lord\nYou can hear the tune played
